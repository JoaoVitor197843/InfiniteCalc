## 🗣️ DESCRIPTION

Infinite Calc is a math library entirely based on python that covers operations and expressions from the simplest to the most complex. In addition, this library includes calculations from other areas such as physics, chemistry, geography and literature.

## ⚒️ FEATURES

- ´Basic Operations´:
  - Addition, Subtract, Multiply, Division.

- ´Avanced Operations´:
  - Power: Calculates the    power of a number raised to N.
  - Nth rooting: Calculates nth roots.
  - Factorial: Calculates the factorial of a number.
  - Logarithms: Calculates logarithms of any base as well as natural logarithms.

- ´Equation Solver´:
  - First-degree equation (linear): Calculates the root of an linear equation.
  - Second-degree equation (Bhaskara's formula): Calculate the 2 roots of a quadratic equation, supporting c = 0.
  - Discriminant(delta): Calculates the discriminant of the quadratic equation.

- ´Mathematics constants with precision´:
  - π: Pi value accurate to 40 decimal places.
  - e: Euler's constant with 40 decimal places of precision.

## ⚙️ INSTALLATION

**Clone the repository**:  

´´´bash git clone <https://github.com/GhostPro1736/InfiniteCalc.git>´´´

**Import the library**:

import InfiniteCalc ´module´

## 📖 USAGE EXAMPLE

### CALCULATING LOGARITHMS OF ANY BASE AND NATURAL LOGARITHMS

from InfiniteCalc import Operations  

**Logarithm of any base**  
print(Operations.log(1000,10)) ≈ 3.0  

**Natural logarithm**  
print(Operations.natural_log(2)) ≈ 0.6931

### BHASKARA'S FORMULA AND DISCRIMINANT DELTA

from InfiniteCalc import EqSolver  

**Quadratic equation**  
print(EqSolver.bhaskara(1,-3,2)) = (2.0, 1.0)  

**Discriminant delta**  
print(EqSolver.delta(1,-3,2)) = 1

## CONSTANTS

from InfiniteCalc import Constants

**Pi value**  
print(Constants.pi)

**Euler's constant**
print(Constants.e)
